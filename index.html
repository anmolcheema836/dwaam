                  Throughout the years, Tanya has collaborated with me &amp; numerous colleagues, &amp; none of us have

                  holidays, which is uncommon among most Advertising Consultants I've worked with.
                  <br /><br />
                  Tanya &amp; I have extensively discussed integrating Free Malaysia Today's advertising assets into the
                  advertising campaigns of the clients mentioned below.
                  <br /><br />
                  She has not only presented me with compelling reasons but also outlined how these assets can be
                  customised to seamlessly align with my clients' advertising campaigns:

                  After discussions &amp; after both Tanya &amp; I brainstorming together, I decided that I will
                  (and already have) advise Al-Rajhi Bank, Bank Negara Malaysia &amp; Measat Satellite to
                  invest part of their advertising budgets with Free Malaysia Today.
                  <br /><br />
                  I will be working closely with Tanya to try to make this happen hopefully by the end of year 2024.
                  What stands out most about Tanya are her exceptional personal traits. Her high emotional intelligence
                  was evident when she refrained from bombarding me with work-related emails or texts while I was on
                  holiday in Europe. Instead, she respected my time off &amp; reached out only after my return to Malaysia,
                  displaying thoughtfulness.

                  Moreover, her humility shines through in our interactions. Whenever she doesn't have an
                  answer to my questions, she never fabricates responses. Instead, she admits not knowing &amp; takes the
                  initiative to research, providing accurate information afterward.
                  <br /><br />
                  Tanya's honesty &amp; integrity are remarkable. She doesn't push advertising offerings that
                  aren't suitable for my clients, emphasizing a win-win scenario for both parties. This genuine approach
                  has built trust, making me confident in proposing her advertising offerings to my clients.

                  <br /><br />
                  Miss Tanya Hyacinth handled our account for this media-targeted event. The event was a challenge from the get-go: We were new to the Malaysian retail market through our first comic inspired fashion store, DC Super Heroes in 1Utama. In addition, our newly-appointed brand ambassador, an untested personality fresh from his win on the One in a Million "Idol" competition.

                  With these on hand, Tanya sat with us &amp; worked through a range of strategies. Her collaborative style of working suits us well. She treats her clients with utmost respect, understanding that though we may not come with a working knowledge of the Malaysian media, she draws upon my strength as the head of Creative to help us optimise our media event.
                  <br /><br />
                  No details were spared; the goodie bags, vouchers, media lists &amp; media how-tos were thought through &amp; executed well by Miss Tanya Hyacinth &amp; her team.

                  As the PR go-to person, it's heartening to know that in the days before the event, she can be reached very late into the night. She can work as late as I do when it comes to crunch time. And that's an excellent attitude.
                  <br /><br />
                  The event spoke for itself. Great media turn-out. The media mileage we got from hiring Miss Tanya &amp; her team was BEYOND our expectations.
                  <br /><br />
                  First media impressions were everything &amp; we made a lasting one. Now we are 5 stores strong with a 6th flagship store just opened in Pavilion, &amp; Faizal Tahir, that once untested personality, is an award-winning rockstar (and still our ambassador).
                  <br /><br />
                  As our Public Relations Consultant, Tanya played a hand in that initial growth whilst we were still seedlings.

                  As a student, Tanya exhibited all-round skills but more particularly in her writing ability &amp; her presentation skills. She demonstrated skillful use of the English language to prepare news releases, brochures &amp; speeches. Her work was often referred to in class as an example of skillful writing using the key tools of public relations &amp; communications.
                  <br /><br />
                  Additionally, she has the ability to put together a presentation &amp; present it well in front of an audience, a requirement in our Public Relations syllabus.

                  Tanya served as digital media consultant to me on all AirAsia campaigns from year 2011 to year 2012 during my tenure at Carat Media Services.
                  <br /><br />
                  At present, Tanya is the person whom I liaise with on Emirates Airlines digital campaigns.
                  <br /><br />
                  Tanya’s job scope in a nutshell would be to translate the airline brands marketing requirements into media objectives by advising on the best portals &amp; placements within websites.

                  This is the last day at our Mont Kiara office, &amp; I think a little piece of good news is worth sharing to commemorate the occasion.
                  <br /><br />

                  <br /><br />
                  Hope I'm not being too dramatic, but I think she deserves a pat on the back (*hint hint Mel). THIS PERSON IS TANYA! WOHOOOO!!!

                  Mazin & i have worked together on many media buys. He managed to convince us to go against our normal

                  In my previous company we, through Mazin, sponsored a football magazine, a motorcycle brand sponsoring
                  a football magazine was unheard of then.
                  <br><br>
                  Most recently we even explored using a high-end magazine platform & the results were ABOVE
                  expectations.

                  Mazin is the one you go to when you want to explore different methods when the usual way does not
                  help.

                  The first project was the sponsorship of the Oh! My English program in support of ExxonMobil
                  Malaysia’s Energy Literacy campaign, as well as enhancing our CSR efforts in promoting English
                  language proficiency among the younger generation. The sponsorship covered a wide scope, ranging from
                  content & script development, brand placement during on-site shooting, to two outreach programs that
                  created sponsorship awareness among our employees and students in Terengganu. IT WAS A HUGE SUCCESS!
